      <h3>Using Events</h3>
      <div>
      <p>
        You can hook up an event in three ways:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Declare it directly in the HTML markup.</li>
          <li>Assign the function to the event property of the element object through JavaScript.</li>
          <li>Use the newer add and remove methods on the element object to associate event handlers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Event Object</h4>
        <div >


        <p>
                      In general, the event object is a common object available within event handlers that provides
            metadata about the event. For example, if keyboard events are being handled, you might
            want to know which key was pressed. If mouse events are being handled, you might want to
            know which mouse button was pressed. The event object contains all these properties. <br>
            The event object is accessed within an event handler function, using the window object as
            shown: <br>
</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="language-javascript">
          var evnt = window.event;
        </code>
    </pre>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  <span><b>INFO: ACCESSING THE EVENT CONTEXT</b></span>
  <p>
    In Internet Explorer, the window event is the method required to access the event object.
    However, in some browsers, the event object is passed to the event function as a
    parameter.
  </p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Declarative event handling</h3>
<div>
    <p>
      Handling events declaratively in the HTML markup is possible by setting up an event handlers
  line within the HTML elements. This is effectively no different than assigning a value to any
  other property or attribute of the HTML element. Look at the following HTML sample:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="language-html">
          &lt html &gt
              &lt head &gt
                      &lt script &gt
                            function onloadHandler() {
                                    alert("hello event.");
                            }
                      &lt /script &gt
              &lt /head&gt
              &lt body onload="onloadHandler();"&gt
              …
              &lt /body&gt
        &lt /html&gt
        </code>
    </pre>
    n this HTML markup, the onload attribute of the body element is assigned JavaScript to
run. The onload event fires when the document itself is fully loaded into the browser. When
the document is loaded, the onload event fires, which calls the onloadHandler function and in
turn shows the alert box. Any events that will be looked at through this objective can be set
up this way directly in the HTML markup. Next, you see how to set up events programmatically
by assigning the function to the event property in JavaScript.

</div>
<h3>Assignment event handling</h3>

<div>
  Assigning the event function to the event property through JavaScript is another way to set
up event handlers. This method has been around for a long time and is still widely used. For
the preceding example of the onload event, the following changes are required to reflect
assigning an event handler through JavaScript:
<pre>
    <code class="language-html">
      &lt html &gt
          &lt head &gt
                  &lt script &gt
                        window.onload = onloadHandler();
                        function onloadHandler() {
                                alert("hello event.");
                        }
                  &lt /script &gt
          &lt /head&gt
          &lt body onload="onloadHandler();"&gt
          …
          &lt /body&gt
    &lt /html&gt
    </code>
</pre>
In this code, the HTML element for the body is cleaned up and the onload event is assigned
in JavaScript. The window object isn’t the same as the body element, but it demonstrates
the concept of assigning code that needs to run as soon as the page is loaded. Notice
that the assignment of the onloadHandler is in the script block but not inside any function.
For this to succeed, the window object must exist. Since the window object is a global object
it will exist. However, to access elements of the page, the page must be loaded or the script
must run after the renderer processes the HTML. For example, if the page has a canvas and
the functionality to enable users to draw on it with a mouse, the event handlers for the mouse
activities would have to be assigned either at the bottom of the page or within the window’s
onload event. The onload event is triggered when the entire page is loaded, so it’s possible to
get a reference to the page elements and hook up the event handlers.
</div>

<h3>Using the <i>addEventListener</i> and <i>removeEventListener</i> methods</h3>
<div >
  <p>
    addEventListener and removeEventListener are the two preferred methods to hook up a function
to an event and then to remove it later as needed. The addEventListener method accepts
two required parameters and one optional parameter:
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
      addEventListener(&ltevent name&gt,&ltevent function&gt,&ltoptional cascade rule&gt)
    </code>
  </pre>
  The event name is the name of the event to be handled. The event name will be as you’ve
seen in the previous examples except without the on prefix. For example, the name of the
onload event is just load. The event function is the one that should run when the event occurs,
the listener. The optional cascade rule provides some flexibility in how the events move through
nested DOM elements. This is examined in more detail later in the discussion on event bubbling.
The removeEventListener takes exactly the same parameters. What this implies is that more
than one event listener can be added for the same event and then removed. Thinking in the
context of a complicated program such as a game, you might need to turn on and off specific
event handlers for the same event. Consider the following example:

</div>

 <script type="text/javascript" src="">
  </script>
  </body>
</html>
